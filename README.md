# gen-ai-reviewer


This app helps developers in reviewing pull requests by the assistance of ChatGPT.

We have created a github application which listens for new open PR events and responds to them with reviews generated by chatGPT. 

ChatGPT goes through the patches for every file in the PR and reviews them. We can set up the following environment variables for the github application.

APP_ID=""
WEBHOOK_SECRET=""
PRIVATE_KEY_PATH=""
MAX_PATCH_LENGTH=""
